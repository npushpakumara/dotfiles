# Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! This collection contains my personal configurations for various tools and environments to streamline my workflow across multiple machines.

## Prerequisites

Before using these dotfiles, make sure you have the following installed:

- [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/): To manage and symlink the configurations.

## Managed Configurations

- **Alacritty**: A clean and minimal terminal setup with custom themes and settings.
- **Git**: Simplified and powerful git commands with aliases and configurations.

## Installation

Clone the repository and use GNU Stow to set up the configurations:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/npushpakumara/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles

stow .
```
